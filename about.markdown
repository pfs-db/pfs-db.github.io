## About Me

Hello, I’m Pablo Freitas, a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems using data-driven insights. I have experience in machine learning, audio and speech recognition, and Python-based development.

I’ve worked on projects involving hate speech detection from audio, where I used advanced tools such as OpenSmile, Whisper, and machine learning models to extract features from audio and classify speech.

### My Key Strengths:

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Experience in building predictive models using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
- **Speech Recognition**: Proficient in using Whisper for transcription and OpenSmile for feature extraction.
- **Data Wrangling**: Extensive experience working with large datasets, feature engineering, and cleaning data using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Data Visualization**: Strong skills in data visualization using tools like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Dash.

You can view some of my projects in the **Projects** section, where I demonstrate my work in hate speech detection, speech-to-text transcription, and other data-driven solutions.
