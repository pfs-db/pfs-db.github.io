## About Me

I'm a data scientist with expertise in Python, machine learning, and speech recognition. Currently working on projects related to hate speech detection and audio analysis.

## Projects

### Hate Speech Detection from Audio (Work in Progress)

- Tools: Python, OpenSmile, Whisper, TensorFlow
- Description: Developing a system to detect hate speech in audio using machine learning models and speech feature extraction. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
<!-- - [View Code](https://github.com/pfs-db/hate-speech-project) -->
- **Current Progress:**
  - Organized folder structure.
  - Initial GUI developed.
